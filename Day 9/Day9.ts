 * Answer : Option [d](All of the above)
 *
 * Explanation:
 *
 * a. Express: Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It simplifies the process of writing server code, and is one of the fundamental libraries for most Node.js applications.
 *
 * b. Body-parser: This is a middleware module for handling JSON, Raw, Text and URL encoded form data. It was a part of Express.js earlier but now you have to install it separately. This module parses the JSON, buffer, string and URL encoded data submitted using HTTP POST request.
 *
 * c. Socket.io: Socket.IO is a JavaScript library for real-time web applications. It enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. It has two parts: a client-side library that runs in the browser, and a server-side library for Node.js.
